        <p class="notes">
       I came home and the first thing I did was take my shoes off. Without hesitation, I realised that this action is my routine. I leave the house every day, which means I can document this action every day. It seems to me that the fastest and less time-consuming way is photography. I did not take photos on the phone because I wanted to make a more stylised project. Polaroid camera helped me with this. I had the opportunity to instantly get a finished photo to further position it in the album and watch the changes in the position of the shoes every day

            mono space fonts will be helpful where you need to find the right information quickly. For example, in tables where you often need to quickly find certain values.

          This project was based on the ability to adapt to the existing system, in this case it was a computer screen saver system. It was necessary to find images (elements) that could complement each other in the process of moving and create a completed work.

        <p>Create a screen saver using the classic and well-known elements</p>
        <p> First of all, I started to create interfering effects on the original screen saver, but 
          that wasnâ€™t the way I wanted to do it
          Different shapes would be perfect for this technique and started experimenting with them
          In the process, I got breasts of field and sky fragments, which I eventually decided to supplement the elements of the Windows operating system in order to make the work more sarcastic and funny</p>
